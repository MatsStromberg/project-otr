Oracle Tablespace Report is used to gather various statistics e.g. Tablespace usage (allocated, used and free) space. The statistics are stored centrally in the OTR Repository. This tool is built using Open BlueDragon. It can be configured to access Oracle Enterprise Manager/Cloud Control to also collect storage usage.
